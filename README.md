# manhandler

**Talk to one agent. Ship across every repo.**

> v0.2.0 · MIT licensed · built for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

*The Dockyard.* You are the captain; the manhandler is your dockmaster — it never
handles cargo itself, but directs a crew of dockhands (crewmates) working in the
holds, hoisting cargo aboard the ships of your fleet, and reports back to you. See
[the theme note](docs/architecture.md#the-dockyard) for the full mapping.

manhandler is an *agent distro* for Claude Code: a portable directory of
instructions, skills, and helper scripts that turns a Claude Code session into a
fleet handler. You talk to a single agent — the **manhandler** — and it runs a
crew of autonomous subagents across all of your repositories: spawning each in
its own clean git worktree, supervising them to completion at zero idle token
cost, and handing you finished PRs, approved local merges, or investigation
reports.

It re-implements the ideas proven by [firstmate](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate),
but built natively for Claude Code instead of on bash + a terminal multiplexer.
Where firstmate builds a shell daemon to *simulate* asynchronous supervision on
generic harnesses, manhandler uses Claude Code's native primitives — background
agents, task-completion notifications, worktree-isolated subagents, Monitor, and
cron — which do the same job with less machinery and no polling. See
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full concept→primitive map.

## What it does

- **One liaison.** You talk only to the manhandler; it delegates, supervises, and
  reports outcomes — never mechanics.
- **A crew in worktrees.** Every task runs in its own disposable git worktree, so
  parallel work on one repo never collides.
- **Two task shapes.** *Ship* delivers a change (PR or approved local merge);
  *scout* investigates and leaves a report — a diagnosis is never an
  authorization to implement.
- **Per-repo + global memory.** Memory is plain markdown, no bespoke tool: each
  managed repo's shared knowledge lives in an `mh:knowledge` section of its own
  `AGENTS.md` (committed, so it travels and reaches crewmates in every worktree),
  with manhandler-private notes in a git-excluded `.mh/`; operator and fleet-wide
  knowledge live in the manhandler's global memory. One owner per fact.
- **Lavish approval, then modular PR pipelines.** Every change is first rendered
  as a lavish artifact you approve (with back-and-forth); then you choose PR or
  local. (The artifact needs the optional `lavish-axi`; without it you approve
  the change directly — see Requirements.) On the PR path, delivery is an
  ordered list of named gates — two review
  passes (coldstart → fix+tests → merge-gate → fix+tests) then PR — declared per
  repo in one JSON array you can reorder. Branches follow `<type>/<issue>/<slug>`;
  descriptions are short and human; nothing merges without your word.
- **Zero-token supervision.** Crewmates run as background agents; a completion
  notification is the wake. Nothing polls while work is in flight.
- **Guarded by construction.** The manhandler is read-only over your repos except
  for narrow, guarded fast-forward paths. Teardown refuses to discard unlanded
  work. Nothing merges red or without your word.
- **Persistent domain supervisors.** For large domains, delegate to a long-lived
  agent that owns a scope, keeps its own memory, and runs its own crew.

## Layout

```
AGENTS.md            the manhandler's operating contract (CLAUDE.md includes it)
docs/architecture.md the design and the firstmate → manhandler mapping
bin/                 the toolbelt; run `bin/mh help` for the full list (`bin/mh <sub>` dispatches to `bin/mh-<sub>.sh`)
.claude/skills/      skills loaded at their trigger points
workflows/           optional deterministic PR-pipeline runner
config/              PR-pipeline defaults and per-repo overrides
state/ repos/ data/  operator-private runtime, clones, and artifacts (gitignored)
```

## Getting started

1. **Clone** this repository and `cd` into it.
2. **Run `bin/mh-doctor.sh`** — it checks your tools and GitHub auth and
   scaffolds the runtime layout (`state/`, `data/`, `repos/`).
3. **Launch Claude Code** in the repo root — `CLAUDE.md` pulls in `AGENTS.md`,
   which activates the manhandler persona.
4. **Ask it to add a repo** and give it work (see Quick start).

## Quick start

```sh
# from a Claude Code session started in this directory:
> add my repo git@github.com:me/app.git and fix the flaky login test in #412
```

The manhandler registers the repo (cloning it and seeding its memory) and spawns
a crewmate in a fresh worktree. It pauses for your approval of the change and
your PR-or-local choice before opening anything, then runs the PR pipeline and
comes back with:

```
PR ready for review: https://github.com/me/app/pull/57
(fix flaky login test — risk: low — tests green)

> merge it
```

Under the hood that is `bin/mh-repo.sh add`, `bin/mh-task.sh new`,
`bin/mh-worktree.sh create`, the `pr-workflow` skill, and `bin/mh-pr.sh merge` —
each usable directly, or through the `bin/mh` dispatcher (`mh <sub> ...` runs
`bin/mh-<sub>.sh ...`; `mh help` lists the subcommands). Run any script with no
arguments for its usage.

## Requirements

Supported platforms: macOS and Linux; the scripts run on bash 3.2+.

- **Required for anything:** Claude Code, `git`, and `jq`.
- **Required for the PR flow:** the GitHub CLI `gh`, authenticated with
  `gh auth login` (or the `gh-axi` wrapper below). Without it the manhandler
  still runs in local-only mode — approved fast-forward landing, no PR.
- **Optional enhancements — the operator's own tooling, not bundled with this
  distro:** `gh-axi` (ergonomic GitHub wrapper), `lavish-axi` (the reviewable
  approval artifact), and `chrome-devtools-axi` (browser tasks). Without them
  the manhandler degrades to a real, plainer mode: plain `gh` for GitHub, and
  you review and approve each change directly rather than through a lavish
  artifact.

Per-repo memory is plain markdown — no extra tool to install. Run
`bin/mh-doctor.sh` to see what you have and what each tool gates.
